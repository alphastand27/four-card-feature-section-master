## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

### What I learned

I did not know to prevent horizontal scrow but I found the following from stack overflow which did just that.

```css
html, body {
    max-width: 100%;
    overflow-x: hidden;
}
```

### Useful resources

- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17756649/disable-the-horizontal-scroll) - This helped me with preventing horizontal scrowing of the page.
